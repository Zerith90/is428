<h3>Project Motivation</h3>

We are seeing an increasing usage of social media as a platform for feedback as compared to other channels. In many cases, feedback is critical to companies to improve their products or to know the customer's perspective of them. Social media has enable news to travel at blazing speeds, from one person to another, much faster than other mediums we see today. Some of us may even hear from friends and families on what is happening around the world before the evening news even get hold of the data. However, much of this data is segregated and unstructured, and the most we can draw out of them is the information that they hold. Little can be told about what led to this information being told, the interactions it has with other news how substantial this piece of information in. This is important in an era where validation of a particular piece of news is vital for its credibility.

<h3>Objective</h3>

In this project, we will be focusing on using the Twitter social media platform. We will be seeking to know more about the following:
Social media has indirectly become one of the biggest feedback platform for users. We would like to be able to analyse this rich content based of a specific hashtag. This can be useful when you want to have a quick overview to see what is being talked about on a particular hashtag and the topics related to it.
We will be analysing tweets based on the frequency of tweets, words that are frequently used in these collection of tweets, interactions between users mentioning this hashtag, concept words that users mention and hashtags that are closely related. The influence of a particular user is based on the inlinks that he/she has while the activeness of a particular user is based on the outlinks.
