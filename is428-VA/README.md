Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. You are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to your field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.
The project is to be done in a team. You are required to form a project team of 2-3 members by the second week of the academic term. Each project team must start thinking about their project ideas after the first lesson. You are expected to discuss your project topic and scope of works with the instructor during the third week of the academic term. A project website must be prepared and uploaded to the course wiki page by week 8.
Each project team will be responsible for presenting the project twice. The first presentation to be carried out in week 9 should focus on the geospatial issues or problems that the project is addressing, the relevant related work, the approach the team plans to take to solve the problem and early prototypes or storyboards. The project teams should take advantage of this presentation as an opportunity to get feedback on the direction of the project from their peers.
In week 13, all project teams will give a poster presentation outlining the motivation of the project, design principles, implementation process, analytical methods used and findings of their project. In week 14, students are also required to submit the final artifact and the project report.
